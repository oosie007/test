# Catalyst Policy Consumer

## Overview
The Catalyst Policy Consumer is a .NET 6.0 web application designed to process and handle policy-related messages and events from multiple message brokers. It serves as a robust, scalable service that can consume messages from both Apache Kafka and Azure Service Bus, process them according to business rules, and maintain a reliable event-driven architecture.

## Features
- üîÑ Multi-broker message consumption (Kafka and Azure Service Bus)
- üîê Secure configuration management with Azure Key Vault
- üìä Real-time monitoring with Application Insights
- üìù Comprehensive logging with NLog
- üîç API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- üíâ Dependency Injection with Autofac
- ‚ö° High-performance message processing
- üîÑ Automatic retry policies
- üöÄ Scalable architecture

## Prerequisites
- .NET 6.0 SDK
- Azure Subscription (for Key Vault and Service Bus)
- Apache Kafka cluster (if using Kafka)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Configuration
The application uses various configuration sources:
- `appsettings.json`
- Azure Key Vault (for secrets)
- Environment Variables

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/Catalyst-Policy-Consumer.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
dotnet restore
```

docker run -p 8080:80 catalyst-policy-consumer
```

## Architecture
The service follows a clean architecture pattern with the following components:

- **API Layer**: REST endpoints for health checks and monitoring
- **Consumer Layer**: Message consumption and processing logic
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core business rules and policy processing
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External service integrations

## Message Processing
The service can process messages from:
1. **Azure Service Bus**
   - Queue-based messaging
   - Dead-letter queue support
   - Message sessions (if configured)

2. **Apache Kafka**
   - Topic-based messaging
   - Consumer group management
   - Partition assignment

## Monitoring and Logging
- Application Insights integration for:
  - Request tracking
  - Dependency monitoring
  - Performance metrics
  - Exception tracking

- NLog configuration for:
  - Structured logging
  - Multiple log targets
  - Log level management

## API Documentation
Swagger UI is available at `/swagger` when running in development mode.

## Health Checks
Health endpoints are available at:
- `/health` - Overall service health
- `/health/ready` - Readiness probe
- `/health/live` - Liveness probe
